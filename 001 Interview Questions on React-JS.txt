   render it in a table. Following are the tasks defined
   Tasks
      1. Fetch the Posts data from the API endpoint -
      https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

   and will start clicking it should render the text in list as much 
   time the button is clicked along with this we need delete functionality also
Q. Open https://codesandbox.io/s/new and create a new React component with 
   2 input fields, input1 and input2.

   You need to ensure that (input2 minus input1) is equal to 1 always. 
   Means if user type value 5 in input1 then input2 value should change to 6 
   (to make input2 - input1 = 1). And similarly, if input2 value is 100 
    then input1 value should change to 99.
